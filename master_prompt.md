# Master Project Prompt: Pablo Fernando Rincón Díaz Portfolio

**Mission Objective:**
Create a production-ready, accessible, and responsive portfolio website using HTML5 and CSS3. The design must be "Senior-Level"—minimalist, modern, and visually striking using a "Slate & Royal Blue" color theme.

**File Structure:**
- `index.html` (Semantic HTML5)
- `styles.css` (Mobile-first CSS)
- `README.md` (Deployment instructions)

**Technical Constraints (Strict):**
1.  **Accessibility (Critical):** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. Use proper ARIA labels, semantic tags, and high-contrast colors.
2.  **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first approach. Ensure layout handles small screens (stacked) and desktop (grid) elegantly.
3.  **Typography:** Use "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif.

**Design Aesthetic (Vivid & Stylized):**
*   **Hero Section:** Use a **very stylized, animated linear gradient** background (Royal Blue to Slate/Dark Blue) that actively moves to show dynamism.
*   **Timeline:** Design the work history as **modern, elevated cards** with entrance animations (slide-in) and interactive hover effects (scale up, shadow depth).
*   **Case Studies:** The cards must match the **Hero Component's gradient exactly** (vivid, animated background) with **White text** to ensure high contrast and readability.
*   **Skill Tags:** Use a premium "pill" design with soft shadows, hover lift effects, and gradient borders/backgrounds.
